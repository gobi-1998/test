It was 2019, my 3rd year in BE. My father has been asked to come for meeting with my class teacher. I thought i'm going to be suspended for making too much troubles. The day came, my father is here and i was packing to leave( in imagination). I was sitting in front of my teacher, i saw a premotion of leaving college or getting debbared to next year. To my suprise, none of that happen that day. Infact the teacher i thought so bad,tell my father that I'm really good and kind and quick to grasp everything. he went and said "he not only hears but truely lisens", those words, i can never forget.
