How to install apache Tomcat in jenkins server using yum and I need to set another port number so when I access it with the ip: port number it should show the index.html file.
Also create a index.html file to view in web address

You can install Apache Tomcat on your Jenkins server running Red Hat Linux using yum and configure it to run on a specific port. Additionally, you can create an index.html file to view at the specified port. Here are the steps:

Install Apache Tomcat using yum:

bash
Copy code
sudo yum install tomcat
Start the Tomcat service and enable it to start on boot:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl start tomcat
sudo systemctl enable tomcat
To change the port that Tomcat listens on, edit the Tomcat configuration file:

bash
Copy code
sudo vi /etc/tomcat/server.xml
Find the line that looks like this:

xml
Copy code
<Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
Change the port attribute to your desired port, for example, 8081:

xml
Copy code
<Connector port="8081" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
Save and exit the editor.

Create an index.html file in the Tomcat webapps directory:

bash
Copy code
sudo vi /var/lib/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/index.html
Add some content to your index.html file, for example:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Welcome to Tomcat</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, Tomcat!</h1>
</body>
</html>
Save and exit the editor.

Restart Tomcat to apply the changes:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart tomcat
Now you can access your Tomcat server with the IP address and the port you specified in the web browser, for example, http://your_server_ip:8081.

Your Tomcat server should now be running on the specified port with the custom index.html file.

Please make sure to replace your_server_ip and the port number with the actual values you want to use.
